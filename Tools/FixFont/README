Fix Font Program


* fixjrfnt.s - Fix PCjr Font Program for DOS

This program reads font from the video BIOS and writes 8x8 font
(except Japanese font) to FONT_8.ROM.

If you could not extract font ROM from JX, you can fill the font used
by PCjr emulation mode with this program.  This program is tested on
QEMU and dosemu.
