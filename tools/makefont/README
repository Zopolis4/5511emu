Make Font Utility


This utility creates font ROM image from public domain Shinonome font
and your video BIOS.  If you could not extract font ROM from JX, this
must be useful.


* Build

Run make.


* Make Font

Put makefont.com and fontsrc.dat in a directory and run the
makefont.com on DOS compatible environment to create FONT_8.ROM,
FONT_9.ROM, FONT_A.ROM and FONT_B.ROM into the directory.  Please note
that change current directory to the directory before running the
program.

This program should work on PCjr, but the fontsrc.dat and output files
need about 400KB space on a disk, so a 720KiB diskette or a hard drive
is required.  Using QEMU or dosemu is much easier than using such
legacy machines.
