* jxfntdmp.s - Font ROM dump program for JX

This program is for DOS on JX.  It saves font ROM to a file named
font.dat.  It is expected to work properly, but not tested on real JX
machine.

See the source code about how to build.


* jxipl.a86

This program is a boot program for JX.  It saves whole memory to a
diskette.

Use r86 assembler in LSI C-86 to assemble.  To make a bootable
diskette, format 2DD 720KB diskette and write the binary to start of
the diskette.  2 sectors are needed.

The program contains Japanese comments and messages.  The source file
encoding is Shift_JIS.

If the program was executed successfully, LBA 2 (track 0 sector 3)
contains memory usage - 16-byte data, 00h means unused block, ffh
means used block, for every 64KiB-block, i.e. the first byte is for
00000h-0ffffh, the second byte is for 10000h-1ffffh, and so on.
Unused block means the block is filled with the value of the first
byte in the block.  From LBA 3, every 64KiB used block is stored.

This program worked on JX-5.
